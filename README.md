PartsOfSpeech_Tagger
====================

This is a parts of speech tagger written in python by Ethan Blackburn. It implements a hidden markov model and the
viterbi algorithm. I recommend testing and training on the 'development.txt' and 'training.txt' files. Using any other 
files will require you to edit the code(only slightly)
